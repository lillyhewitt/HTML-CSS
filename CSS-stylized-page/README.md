We will be creating a microsite for a fictional landscape architect, Jane Doe. Please recreate the screenshot as well as what I demonstrated in class. The PDF includes the basic HTML structure, but you will need to add appropriate CSS (position, font-family, font-size, color, and more) to successfully recreate the site.
