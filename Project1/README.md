Our first project will be to create a functioning website built with HTML and styled with CSS that will incorporate:

Homepage 
-Nav menu including links to your homepage, a link to your subpage, and 2 other external links. The external links should open in a new window. (this exact nav should be duplicated and used for your subpage)

-Section 1: A hero image with a header/title

-Section 2: An intro paragraph with a subheading, paired with an image in two columns

-Section 3: A paragraph with additional interesting facts with a subheading. This should be paired with another image and laid out in 2 columns. Use two instances of inline styling in the paragraph (<em> <strong> <b> <i> or <span>)

-Section 4: Paragraph and image referring the topic of your subpage again in two columns, with a link to your subpage
