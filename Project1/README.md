Our first project will be to create a functioning website built with HTML and styled with CSS that will incorporate:
-reproducible layout/structure
-multiple pages 
-homepage 
-1 subpage
-You have three options to choose from when picking a topic:

-An animal or type of animal (homepage) + specific breed or species (sub-page)
-A website about big cats with a subpage about tigers
-A website about dog with a subpage about Jack Russell Terriers
-A kind of plant + a subpage about a specific species of plant
-A website about trees with a subpage about white birch trees
-A website about flowers with a subpage about begonias
-A sports team + a subpage about a specific player
-A website about the 76ers with subpage about Joel Embiid
-A website about the Phillies with a subpage about Bryce Harper
-Content

This is not a research project, but you will need to gather content to fill out your site. Wikipedia, Google search, and Adobe stock (students have access to free downloads) are all viable resources. No need to cite your sources, or do a lot of work to put it into your own words. It should make sense in context, but the goal of this project is to put your coding into practice, so donâ€™t worry about just copying and pasting content. 

Homepage 
-Nav menu including links to your homepage, a link to your subpage, and 2 other external links. The external links should open in a new window. (this exact nav should be duplicated and used for your subpage)
-Section 1: A hero image with a header/title
-Section 2: An intro paragraph with a subheading, paired with an image in two columns
-Section 3: A paragraph with additional interesting facts with a subheading. This should be paired with another image and laid out in 2 columns. Use two instances of inline styling in the paragraph (<em> <strong> <b> <i> or <span>)
-Section 4: Paragraph and image referring the topic of your subpage again in two columns, with a link to your subpage
