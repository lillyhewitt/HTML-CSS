        <h2>What's a Bird?</h2>
        <p>
          Birds are a group of warm-blooded vertebrates constituting the class
          Aves (/ˈeɪviːz/), characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws,
          the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a
          four-chambered heart, and a strong yet lightweight skeleton. Birds
          live worldwide and range in size from the 5.5 cm (2.2 in) bee
          hummingbird to the 2.8 m (9 ft 2 in) common ostrich. There are about
          ten thousand living species, more than half of which are passerine, or
          "perching" birds. Birds have wings whose development varies according
          to species; the only known groups without wings are the extinct moa
          and elephant birds. Wings, which are modified forelimbs, gave birds
          the ability to fly, although further evolution has led to the loss of
          flight in some birds, including ratites, penguins, and diverse endemic
          island species. The digestive and respiratory systems of birds are
          also uniquely adapted for flight. Some bird species of aquatic
          environments, particularly seabirds and some waterbirds, have further
          evolved for swimming. The study of birds is called ornithology.

        <h2>Evolution</h2>
        <p>
          Over <b>40% of key traits</b> found in modern birds evolved during the
          <b>60 million year transition</b> from the earliest bird-line
          archosaurs to the first maniraptoromorphs, i.e. the first dinosaurs
          closer to living birds than to Tyrannosaurus rex. The loss of
          osteoderms otherwise common in archosaurs and acquisition of primitive
          feathers might have occurred early during this phase. After the
          appearance of Maniraptoromorpha, the next 40 million years marked a
          continuous reduction of body size and the accumulation of neotenic
          (juvenile-like) characteristics. Hypercarnivory became increasingly
          less common while braincases enlarged and forelimbs became longer.
          <i>The integument evolved into complex, pennaceous feathers</i>.

        <h2>Learn about Flamingos</h2>
        <p>
          The American flamingo (Phoenicopterus ruber) is a large species of
          flamingo native to the West Indies, northern South America (including
          the Galápagos Islands) and the Yucatan Peninsula. It is closely
          related to the greater flamingo and Chilean flamingo, and was formerly
          considered conspecific with the greater flamingo, but that treatment
          is now widely viewed (e.g. by the American and British Ornithologists'
          Unions) as incorrect due to a lack of evidence. It is also known as
          the Caribbean flamingo, although it is also present in the Galápagos
          Islands. It is the only flamingo that naturally inhabits North
          America.
